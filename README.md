### WHAT IS

- rendering concept that focuses on tracking the userâ€™s position and only committing what is visually relevant to the DOM in any given scroll position.
- It provides us with all the benefits of pagination along with the UX of infinite scrolling.

### BENEFITS

- you don't need to pay the cost of thousands of rows of data being rendered at once

### HOW TO CALCULATE

- We pre-calculate the total height of our list using the dimensions of the given list items
- and multiplying it by the count of our list items.
- then, we position the items to create a list that the user can scroll through.

### HOW IT WORKS

Infinite Scroll
